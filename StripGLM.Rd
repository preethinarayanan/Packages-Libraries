\title{Strip GLM}
\usage{
StripGLM(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{the model object you would like to strip down}
}
\value{
returns the stripped model object; do not use this function if you need to perform other processes besides prediction of test cases
}
\description{
Strips the glm object of most of the unused items that inflate storage size, however the resulting object will only be able to predict new test cases
}
\examples{
model <- glm(mpg ~., data = mtcars[1:25,]) # list of 30 items
model <- StripGLM(model) # now list of 21 items
preds <- predict(model, newdata = mtcars[26:32,]) # still runs
