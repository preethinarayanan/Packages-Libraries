\usage{
ModelSummaryLogger(
  model = NULL,
  pin_name_basic = NULL,
  desired_pin_name_basic = NULL,
  pin_name_coef = NULL,
  desired_pin_name_coef = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{fitted model object you would like to log information on}

\item{pin_name_basic}{the name of the pin that already exists to log the basic info from your model}

\item{desired_pin_name_basic}{the desired name of the pin used to log the basic info from you rmodel, if a pin does not already exist}

\item{pin_name_coef}{the name of the pin that already exists to log the coefficients from your model}

\item{desired_pin_name_coef}{the desired name of the pin used to log the coefficients from your model, if a pin does not already exist}
}
\value{
an updated pin object or a new pin object if one was not created already
}

\examples{
# model <- glm(mpg ~ factor(gear) + hp + factor(am), mtcars, family = "gaussian")

# this will create arbitrary pin logs using the model id
# ModelSummaryLogger(model = model)

# this will create logs using the desired names that were inputted
# ModelSummaryLogger(model = model, desired_pin_name_basic = "cool_basic_model_log",
#                  desired_pin_name_coef = "cool_coef_model_log")

# this will update the existing pins that were provided as inputs
# ModelSummaryLogger(model = model, pin_name_basic = "wc-model-basic",
#                    pin_name_coef = "wc-model-coef")
ModelSummaryLogger(model = model, desired_pin_name_basic = "cool_basic_model_log",
                   desired_pin_name_coef = "cool_coef_model_log")

# this will update the existing pins that were provided as inputs
ModelSummaryLogger(model = model, pin_name_basic = "wc-model-basic",
                   pin_name_coef = "wc-model-coef")

# if you are using this for the first time with no pin_name for basic or coef
# then the function will create a  pin for you of the name

# "model_logger_coef_id number" for the coef table and
# "model_logger_basic_id number" for the basic summary table

# once this is created, please feel free to rename it and then fill
# in the pin_name input before you run it again to update it
